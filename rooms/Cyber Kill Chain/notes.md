🔗 Cyber Kill Chain
📌 Overview

The Cyber Kill Chain, developed by Lockheed Martin, is a model that outlines the stages of a cyberattack.
It helps defenders understand how attacks progress and identify opportunities to detect, deny, disrupt, or contain adversaries.

🛠 Kill Chain Stages

1. Reconnaissance

Attackers research targets and gather information.

Example: identifying vulnerable vendors (as in the Target breach).

2. Weaponization

Attacker creates a malicious payload or exploit.

Example: malware bundled with a spearphishing attachment.

3. Delivery

Transmission of the malicious payload to the target.

Example: spearphishing attachment sent via email.

4. Exploitation

Payload is executed to exploit a vulnerability.

Example: exploit public-facing application.

5. Installation

Malware establishes persistence on the system.

Example: dynamic linker hijacking.

6. Command & Control (C2)

Attacker establishes communication with compromised systems.

Example: fallback channels for remote access.

7. Actions on Objectives

Final stage where attackers achieve their goal.

Example: data from local system (exfiltration of credit card data).

✅ Key Takeaway

The Cyber Kill Chain breaks down attacks into 7 stages.

Defenders can detect, block, or disrupt the attack at multiple points.

In the Target breach, weaknesses in detection allowed attackers to move from delivery → exploitation → data theft.
