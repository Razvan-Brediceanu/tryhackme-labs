## 🔧 Reverse Engineering & Debugging

Reverse engineering is like solving a puzzle backward: you take a finished product apart to understand how it works. Debugging is identifying errors, understanding why they happen, and correcting the code to prevent them.

- 🟢 **Ghidra** — NSA-developed open-source reverse-engineering suite
- 🟢 **x64dbg** — Open-source debugger for x64/x86 binaries
- 🟢 **OllyDbg** — Debugger at the assembly level
- 🟢 **Radare2** — Sophisticated open-source reversing framework
- 🟢 **Binary Ninja** — Disassembler & decompiler
- 🟢 **PEiD** — Packer, cryptor, and compiler detection

## 📜 Disassemblers & Decompilers

Disassemblers and decompilers help analysts understand malware by breaking it into a more human-readable format.

- 📖 **CFF Explorer** — PE file analyzer/editor
- 📖 **Hopper** — Debugger, disassembler, decompiler
- 📖 **RetDec** — Open-source machine-code decompiler

## 🔍 Static & 🏃 Dynamic Analysis

- **Static analysis** 🧊: inspect code without executing it
- **Dynamic analysis** 🔥: run it in a safe environment to observe behavior

Tools:

- 🔧 **Process Hacker** — Memory editor & process watcher
- 🔧 **PEview** — PE file viewer
- 🔧 **Dependency Walker** — Shows DLL dependencies
- 🔧 **DIE (Detect It Easy)** — Packer/compiler/cryptor detection
- 🔧 **CAPA** — Identify malicious capabilities in binaries
