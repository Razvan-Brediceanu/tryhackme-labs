Principles of Security covers the foundational concepts that protect information systems from unauthorized access, misuse, and disruption.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### CIA Triad

- **Confidentiality** – Preventing unauthorized access to data
- **Integrity** – Ensuring data is accurate and unaltered

### Authentication vs Authorization

- **Authentication** – Verifying identity
- **Authorization** – Granting access rights

### Least Privilege

Users and systems should only have the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks.

### Defense in Depth

Using multiple layers of security controls to protect systems from different attack vectors.

### Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risk

- **Threat** – Potential cause of harm
- **Vulnerability** – Weakness that can be exploited
- **Risk** – Likelihood and impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability

## 🛠️ Security Controls

- Administrative
- Technical
- Physical

## ✅ Key Takeaway
