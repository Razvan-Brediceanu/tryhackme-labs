# 🚶 Walking An Application

## 📌 Overview

Walking An Application focuses on manually reviewing a web application for security issues using only a web browser and its built-in developer tools.  
No automated tools or scripts are used, emphasizing understanding application behavior.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Manual Testing

Analyzing a web application by interacting with it directly through the browser to identify unexpected behavior or weaknesses.

### Browser Developer Tools

Using tools such as:

- Elements (HTML & DOM inspection)
- Network (requests & responses)
- Console (JavaScript analysis)
- Storage (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage)

### Client-Side Security

Identifying weaknesses such as:

- Exposed sensitive data
- Insecure JavaScript logic
- Hidden functionality
- Client-side validation flaws

### Authentication & Session Handling

Inspecting cookies, tokens, and session behavior to identify insecure implementations.

### Input Handling

Testing forms, parameters, and requests to see how user input is processed.

## 🧠 Mindset

Thinking like an attacker by observing application logic and trusting nothing on the client side.

## ✅ Key Takeaway

Manual application walkthroughs help uncover logic flaws and client-side issues that automated tools often miss.
